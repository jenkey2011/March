# hexo-theme-march

Hexo-theme-march is a simple & beautiful & fast theme for Hexo. The core is inspired by the [hexo-theme-melody](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/hexo-theme-melody), so the Documentation of hexo-theme-march are compatible with hexo-theme-melody on the whole. What's more, hexo-theme-march also extends some features based on hexo-theme-melody.
